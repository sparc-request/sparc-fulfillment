    #WARNING TO FUTURE DEVS:  This callback is going to be very complicated because the order of presentation matters in the apppointments list.  Further, we have to account for the possibility of arbitrary custom appointments that can be added to each subject which are not visible to the visit group but whose order matters for the specific subject in question.  All of this means we can't simply work off of the visit group position for the ordering and re-ordering of appointments but have to customize the position of each individual appointment within the unique context of the appointment list of a given subject.
